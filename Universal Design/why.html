        <h2>Why Is Accessible Design So Important?</h2>
        <p>Within the coming decades, the number of people who will be capable of assisting older people will gradually decrease. Meanwhile the life expectancy of those with impairments is only increasing. Without able bodied young individuals to assist those with disabilities, it becomes imperative that accessible design be implemented so that people can be self sufficient.</p>
        <p>Disabilities also effect younger people in education, often to a stronger degree than in adulthood. As academia becomes more digitized, a lack of accessible web design could stunt the learning capacities of these individuals and hold them back from the rest of their peers. To get an idea of this, here's an example:</p>
        <p><i>Trevor is a bright 18-year-old who plays games and watches music videos on his laptop. He lives at home with his parents and younger sister. He attends a special school where the teachers and staff can help with his social and communication challenges from his Autism Spectrum Disorder, while he works to pass his high school exams. He has problems with visual information and recognizing things on the page, and his reading skills are not helped by his trouble concentrating on the page or screen long enough to read.</i></p>
        <p>Autism is a disorder that can have severe effects on younger people's abilities to process information. Accessible design could accomodate for these issues by creating web layouts that are simple in style and easy to navigate, allowing people like Trevor to learn at the same pace as their peers and ensuring they don't fall behind.</p>
