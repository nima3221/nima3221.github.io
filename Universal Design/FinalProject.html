        <h2>What is Accessible Design?</h2>
        <p><i>"Universal Design is founded on the view that there is a wide
spectrum of human abilities and that an individualâ€™s abilities
change over time and in different situations. A Universal
Design approach considers the needs of the diverse range of abilities of
users in order to create a design that meets the needs of as many people
as possible, including people with disabilities."</i> - <strong>Howard Kramer, <i>Universal Design for Digital Media</i></strong></p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Accessible design</strong>, which can also be described as <strong>"universal design"</strong>, is a term used to describe design that acknowledges the fact that Every individual has a limit to what they can physically and intellectually comprehend, and incorporates that into it's functionality.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In the same way that foreign media uses subtitles and translation to break down the language barrier and reach global audiences, accesible design seeks to break down the barrier that excludes people with disabilities from accessing the web in the same way that those without disabilities can.</p>

        <h2>The 7 Principles of Accessible Design</h2>
        <p><strong>Principle 1: Equitable Use</strong> - The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Principle 2: Flexibility in Use</strong> - The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use</strong> - Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</p>
        <p><strong>Principle 4: Perceptible Information</strong> - The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Principle 5: Tolerance for Error</strong> - The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</p>
        <p><strong>Principle 6: Low Physical Effort</strong> - The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</p>
        <p><strong>Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use</strong> - Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.</p>
