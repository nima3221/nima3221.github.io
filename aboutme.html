            <h3>Hey! My name is Nikhil Madhu but I go by Nik or Nick.</h3>
            <h3>I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Creative Technology and Design in the School of Engineering and Arts.</h3>
            <h3>I am interested in creative storytelling and various creative storytelling mediums. I am interested in 2D and 3D animation, as well as graphic design. I am passionate about filmmaking, both the technical and literary aspects of it. Game design is also something I would like to get into. My dream would be to direct my own film, design my own game, or work in animation.</h3>
            <h3>My hobbies include video games, reading (especially comic books), watching movies, art, playing the piano, and working out.</h3>
            <h3>Thank you for visiting my page and feel free to reach out to me!</h3>
